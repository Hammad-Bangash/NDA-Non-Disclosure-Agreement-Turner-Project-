# NDA-Non-Disclosure-Agreement Turner Project

Welcome to the repository for the NDA Turner Project, where we revolutionize Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) processing through automation and AI-driven solutions. As the Backend Engineer and AI Specialist, my role was pivotal in developing robust APIs and implementing advanced algorithms to ensure compliance and efficiency in NDA management.

## Project Overview

The NDA Turner Project aims to automate the processing and compliance checking of NDAs, streamlining the document review and approval process for clients. Leveraging Node.js for backend development and advanced Language Model (LLM) algorithms, we ensure legal accuracy while preserving document format and structure integrity.

## Key Features

### Backend Development with Node.js

I led the backend development efforts, focusing on:
- **API Development:** Created robust RESTful APIs for uploading, processing, and analyzing NDAs.
- **Integration:** Integrated with IMAP protocol for email automation, allowing seamless document upload directly from client emails.
- **Data Handling:** Ensured secure and efficient handling of NDA documents while maintaining document structure integrity.

### AI-driven Compliance Checking

Utilizing advanced Language Model (LLM) algorithms, we:
- **Automated Rule Analysis:** Analyzed uploaded NDAs against predefined rules to identify compliance issues.
- **Redlining and Document Revision:** Automatically redlined NDAs to highlight non-compliant sections and proposed revisions.
- **Summary Generation:** Generated summaries of changes made, ensuring transparency and clarity in document modifications.

### Custom Text Editor Interface

Developed a user-friendly text editor interface:
- **Interactive Document Modification:** Allowed users to interactively modify and approve NDA revisions directly within the application.
- **Format Preservation:** Ensured that document formatting (e.g., bold, italic, lists) was maintained throughout the editing process.

### Automated Document Delivery

Implemented automated document delivery through email:
- **Prompt Distribution:** Sent redlined and executed NDA documents back to clients via email, optimizing workflow efficiency and client satisfaction.
- **Integration with Web Application:** Integrated email automation with the web application to handle document uploads and deliveries seamlessly.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced AI Capabilities:** Introduce machine learning for more nuanced compliance checking and document analysis.
- **Expand Language Support:** Extend the capability to process NDAs in multiple languages for global clientele.
- **Improved User Interface:** Enhance the text editor interface for better usability and functionality based on user feedback.
